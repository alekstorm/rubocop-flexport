# RuboCop Flexport

This repo contains Flexport's formatting configuration for RuboCop and few
custom formatting RuboCop rules. Our intention is generally to upstream all
of the cops in the repository to the core RuboCop repo(s). But we maintain
this repo as a place to open source our cops prior to their upstreaming.

## Installation

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```
gem 'rubocop-flexport'
